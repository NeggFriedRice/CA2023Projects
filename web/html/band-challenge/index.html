            <li><h4>Who are they?</h4>
                <p><strong>The Bee Gees</strong> were a musical group, first formed in 1958 by three brothers Barry, Robin and Maurice Gibb. The trio were especially successfully in pop music in the late 1960s and early 1970s with a pivot to disco music which brought them heightened popularity in the mid- to late 1970s.</p>
                <p>Amongst a plethora of albums the trio found success in a collaboration with Stigwood in the creation of a collection of songs that would mark a turning point in their career -- <strong><em>Saturday Night Fever</em></strong> soundtrack. The brothers wrote the songs "virtually in a single weekend" while holidaying in France with Bill Oakes, soundtrack supervisor, saying the vibe the boys produced breathed new life into a genre that was on the decline.</p>
            <li><h4>Where are they now?</h4>
                <p>Sadly, Barry Gibb is now the only surviving member of the Bee Gees. His younger brothers, fraternal twins, Robin and Maurice Gibb died in 2012 and 2003, respectively. Leaving the disco era behind, Barry Gibb is still releasing music as a solo artist with his latest album <strong><em>Greenfields: The Gibb Brothers' Songbook (Vol. 1)</em></strong> coming out on January 2021.</p>
